-----------------
Flay ran through his approach to the VM:

hit it in a browser. checked robots.txt
^ Found a wp install

Ran Scans:
nmap -A > nmap-versionscan
nikto --host 10.0.1.158 > nikto-search
wpscan --url 10.0.1.158

enumerated the unames
wpscan --url 10.0.1.158/wordpress/ --enumerate u
Found admin

Was prepared to brute force, but guessed a few passwords and found a working one.

Immediately went to plugins area. Googled a php reverse shell, turned it into a plugin and zipped it up. Uploaded it and had it call back.

for the listener :
nc -lp portnumber

Caught the reverse shell

just started digging around (Actually crashed the service with overly invasive scans) until I found a configuration file with root creds.

-----------------

Mistakes: As soon as I got the nmap scan I started looking at vulnerable services and hitting exploitdb for rce instead of immediately moving to wordpress.

My reverse shell wasn't nearly as cool as ksi's

Resources
-----------------

KSI found a way cooler interactive shell than I used. Its right here.

We'll start trying to hit some of these in the coming weeks: http://www.abatchy.com/2017/02/oscp-like-vulnhub-vms.html

We're moving the start time to 7:00pm

Though most of us are less comfortable with web-apps, its agreed that focusing on priv-esc is more valuable to cover in person as there are so many concrete resources for web-apps available.

We're going to start trying to and youtube the live screenshares. 

Flay created this repo for anyone who wanted to add their scripts.
